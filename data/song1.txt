stained coffee cup
just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
sweet, where you lay
still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

waking up, beside you i'm a loaded gun, i can't contain this anymore
i'm all yours, i've got no control, no control
powerless, and i don't care it's obvious, i just can't get enough of you
the pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

taste, on my tongue
i don't want to wash away the night before
in the heat, where you lay
i could stay right here and burn in it all day

waking up, beside you i'm a loaded gun, i can't contain this anymore
i'm all yours, i've got no control, no control
powerless, and i don't care it's obvious, i just can't get enough of you
the pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

lost my senses, i'm defenseless, her perfume's holding me ransom
sweet and sour, heart devoured, lying here i count the hours

waking up, beside you i'm a loaded gun, i can't contain this anymore
i'm all yours, i've got no control, no control
powerless, and i don't care it's obvious, i just can't get enough of you
the pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
no control
no control
powerless, and i don't care it's obvious, i just can't get enough of you
the pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
