i've been holding out so long
i've been sleeping all alone
lord, i miss you
i've been hanging on the phone
i've been sleeping all alone
i want to kiss you sometime

ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

well, i've been haunted in my sleep
you've been starring in my dreams
lord, i miss you, child
i've been waiting in the hall
been waiting on your call
when the phone rings
it's just some friends of mine that say
"hey, what's the matter, man?
we're goingna come around at twelve
with some puerto rican girls thats just dying to meet you
we're goinna bring a case of wine
hey, let's go mess and fool around
you know, like we used to"

ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

oh, everybody waits so long
oh, baby, why you waitin' so long?
won't you come on, come on?
i've been walkin' central park, singing after dark
people think i'm crazy
stumbling on my feet, shuffling through the street
asking people, "what's the matter with you, boy?"
sometimes, i want to say to, to myself
sometimes i say

ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh, ooh, i won't miss you child

i guess i'm lying to myself
it's just you and no one else
lord, i won't miss you, child
you've just been blotting out my mind
fooling on my time
no, i won't miss you, baby, yeah

ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
lord, i miss you child
ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
lord, i miss you child
ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
why, why, why, why
